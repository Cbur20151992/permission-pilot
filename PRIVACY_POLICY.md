# Privacy policy

This is the privacy policy for the Android app "Permission Pilot".

## Preamble

Permission Pilot respects your privacy.

I do not collect, share or sell personal information.

Send a [quick mail](mailto:support@darken.eu) if you have questions.

My underlying privacy principle is the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule).

## Automatic crash reports

Anonymous device information may be collected in the event of an app crash or error.

To do this the app uses the service "Bugsnag":
https://www.bugsnag.com/

Bugsnag's privacy policy can be found here:
https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/

Crash reports may contain device and app related information, e.g.:

* Your phone model, Android version and app version
* The name of an app, if it is the cause of an error

You can disable automatic reports in the app's settings.
